Revision history for WebService-Linode

0.04  Mon Aug 10 21:45:49 EDT 2009
    - Update to Linode.com API version 2.0 -- This is a pretty big change,
      includes support for Linodes now as well as DNS
    - WebService::Linode::DNS is now deprecated but /should/ continue to work.
      changing to WebService::Linode should be straight forward with a few
      method names changed to match the Linode.com methods with dots replaced
      with under scores.
